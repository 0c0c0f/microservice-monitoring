# Microservice Monitoring

Monitor logs, metrics, pings, and traces of your distributed (micro-) services. There are also [slides](https://speakerdeck.com/xeraa/360-degrees-monitoring-of-your-microservices) walking you through the features of this repository.



## Features

1. **Metricbeat System**: Show the *[Metricbeat System] Overview* dashboard in Kibana and then switch to *[Metricbeat System] Host overview* with auto-refresh, run *bad.jar* with `java -Xmx512m -jar /opt/bad.jar`, and see the spike. Optionally build a nicer overview with the [Time Series Visual Builder](img/visualbuilder-cpu.png).
1. **Packetbeat**: Show the *[Packetbeat] Overview*, *[Packetbeat] Flows*, and *[Packetbeat] HTTP* dashboard, let attendees hit */*, */good*, */bad*, and */foobar* a few times, and see the corresponding graphs. Optionally show the *[Packetbeat] DNS Tunneling* and *[Packetbeat] TLS Sessions* dashboards as well.
1. **Filebeat modules**: Show the *[Filebeat Nginx] Access and error logs*, *[Filebeat System] Syslog dashboard*, and *[Filebeat System] SSH login attempts* dashboards.
1. **Filebeat**: Let attendees hit */good* with a parameter and point out the MDC logging under `json.name` and the context view for one log message. Let attendees hit */bad* and */null* to show the stacktrace both in the JSON log file and in Kibana by filtering down on `application:java` and `json.severity: ERROR`. Also point out the `meta.*` information and `json.stack_hash`, which you could also visualize in a bar chart.
1. **Auditbeat**: Show changes to the */opt/* folder with the *[Auditbeat File Integrity] Overview* dashboard.
1. **Heartbeat**: Run Heartbeat and show the *Heartbeat HTTP monitoring* dashboard in Kibana, then kill the frontend application and see the change.
1. **Metricbeat nginx**: Show the values of `nginx.stubstatus` and optionally visualize `nginx.stubstatus.active`.
1. **Metricbeat HTTP**: Show */health* and */metrics* with cURL (credentials are `admin` and `secret`). Then collect the same information with Metricbeat's HTTP module and show it in Kibana's Discover tab.
1. **Metricbeat JMX**: Display the same */health* and */metrics* data and its collection through JMX.
1. **Visual Builder**: Build a more advanced visualization with the Time Series Visual Builder, for example the [heap usage](img/visualbuilder-heapusage.png) and include the deployment *events* as an [annotation](img/visualbuilder-annotation.png).
1. **Sleuth & Zipkin**: Show the traces in the log so far. Then let the attendees hit */call* and */call-bad* to see where the slowness is coming from and how errors look like.
  Also use the [Zipkin Chrome extension](https://github.com/openzipkin/zipkin-browser-extension) to show the current call. And you can even use the `ZIPKIN_UI_LOGS_URL` to link back to the relevant Kibana logs.
1. **Kibana Dashboard Mode**: Point attendees to the Kibana instance to let them play around on their own.



## Setup

If the network connection is decent, show it on [Amazon Lightsail](https://amazonlightsail.com). Otherwise fall back to the local setup and have all the dependencies downloaded in advance.



### Lightsail

Make sure you have run this before the demo, because some steps take time and require a decent internet connection.

1. Make sure you have your AWS account set up, access key created, and added as environment variables in `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`. Protip: Use [https://github.com/sorah/envchain](https://github.com/sorah/envchain) to keep your environment variables safe.
1. Create the Elastic Cloud instance with the same version as specified in *variables.yml*'s `elastic_version`, enable Kibana as well as the GeoIP & user agent plugins, and set the environment variables with the values for `ELASTICSEARCH_HOST`, `ELASTICSEARCH_USER`, `ELASTICSEARCH_PASSWORD`, as well as `KIBANA_HOST`, `KIBANA_ID`.
1. Change into the *lightsail/* directory.
1. Change the settings to a domain you have registered under Route53 in *inventory*, *variables.tf*, and *variables.yml*. Set the Hosted Zone for that domain and export the Zone ID under the environment variable `TF_VAR_zone_id`. If you haven't created the Hosted Zone yet, you should set it up in the AWS Console first and then set the environment variable.
1. If you haven't installed the AWS plugin for Terraform, get it with `terraform init` first. Then create the keypair, DNS settings, and instances with `terraform apply`.
1. Open HTTPS on the network configuration on all instances (waiting for this [Terraform issue](https://github.com/terraform-providers/terraform-provider-aws/issues/700)).
1. Apply the base configuration to all instances with `ansible-playbook configure_all.yml`.
1. Apply the instance specific configuration with `ansible-playbook configure_monitor.yml` â€” frontend and backend don't have specific configurations.
1. Deploy the JARs with `ansible-playbook deploy_bad.yml`, `ansible-playbook deploy_backend.yml`, `ansible-playbook deploy_frontend.yml`, and `ansible-playbook deploy_zipkin.yml` (Ansible is also building them).

When you are done, remove the instances, DNS settings, and key with `terraform destroy`.



### Local

Make sure you have run this before the demo, because some steps take time and require a decent internet connection.

1. Change into the *local/* directory.
1. Run `docker-compose up`, which will bring up Elasticsearch, Kibana, and all the Beats.
1.
1.
1. Run the Java applications from their directories with `gradle bootRun`.
1.

When you are done, stop the Java applications and remove the Docker setup with `docker-compose down -v`.



## Todo

* MySQL on the backend with TCP Heartbeat monitoring
* Docker
* Fix Metricbeat for HTTP /metrics
* Improve traced methods and add async
